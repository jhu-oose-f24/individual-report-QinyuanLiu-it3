In this iteration, I was mainly responsible for writing the back-end matching algorithm. Then I updated the UI of Discover Page, Blogdetailpage, then the logic and UI of job search in search tab, and the logic and UI of job positiondetailpage. 

I think everyone's doing their thing, which is great!
